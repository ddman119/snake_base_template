This is where the snake.py runtime script and snake binary file is located and executed from.

If you are confused, you may execute the game in the following manner:

Using 1 computer/terminal, to setup the server:

./snake -s

Using another computer/terminal, to setup the client:

./snake -c [IP ADDRESS OF SERVER]

Side Notes:

- A total of 4 players are supported (1 server and 3 clients).
- If a player drops out and is the client, then that snake object will be destroyed but the game will continue.
- If a player drops out and is the server, then the game for all players will be exited.
- In order to play on different machines, please connect using the same network. 
- If using VM on a machine like VirtualBox, make sure the network setting for that VM is set to Bridged Adapter, NOT NAT.
